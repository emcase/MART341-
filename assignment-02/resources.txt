A directory is a repository or folder for storing files; text files, image files etc...
VCS (Version Control System) is useful in that it stores changes to files over time.  It allows one to undo or cancel changes made.
Acrylic Paint.  I enjoy paint pouring on canvas and furniture using acrylic paints.
