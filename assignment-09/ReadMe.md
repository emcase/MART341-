# Assignment-09

I enjoy working with html to create webpages. I find it fairly easy as long as you don't forget any needed mark/symbol. And if you do forget something, you will notice when you open the webpage and something isn't there or doesn't work/ is out of place. I do find it challenging to link the screenshot to this ReadMe page. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it seems to never show up when I load everything to GitHub.

As far as learning CSS, I am very excited! I really enjoy learning how to style the webpage and how to make it look a specific way.
