                      <p>The practice of yin yoga offers you the opportunity to balance the active and external yang energy with the passive and internal yin energy. You will be guided through a series of floor-based poses (held 3-5 minutes) which targets the deeper connective tissue, including ligaments, joints and fascia. Using the support of props, active relaxation of muscles is encouraged, as you find your way into a gentle meditation.Perfect for the day that you want to sustain awesome energy or need to relax your busy mind! All levels welcomed.

                      <p>SerenityFlow is Serenity Yogas's signature format. This mind-body practice moves as a wave, starting with a deep breathing, a grounded warm up, transitioning into a flow of standing postures. Once familiar with the postures you'll flow, breath-to-movement, peaking at fun and challenging balancing postures. The wave will take you into a blissful and connected cool down. The intention of this practice is to remove blockages in the body and mind, opening you up to endless possibility. This class moves and is taught as a truly ALL levels class.
