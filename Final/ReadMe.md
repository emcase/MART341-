# Assignment-13

The goal of my website is for users to easily be able to find any information they may be searching for. They should easily be able to navigate from the home page to all other pages. My goal is that the user is able to view what types of yoga classes are offered, to view weekly schedules of classes, to see and register for upcoming workshops or retreats, to be able to view different types of accommodation and book/reserve in advance, to learn about the instructors, and to be able to reach out with and questions or concerns they may have.
