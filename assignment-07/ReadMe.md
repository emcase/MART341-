# Assignment7

I've come across many forms while on the web. The most common would be the "text box" used with Google, and it's purpose is to let me type in what I am searching for. I've come across the buttons "previous" and "next" while browsing shopping sites. The buttons are very straightforward in what their purpose is, to go forwards or backwards. I've used "text entry" a few times to enter my email address because I'd forgotten my log in information and needed to reset it. And I use "password input" anytime I login to Cyberbear or Moodle. Again, the purpose of this is to ensure that is me, the one enrolled in courses, who is logging in and using these resources.
