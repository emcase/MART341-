        Canadian poet, illustrator, and author Rupi Kaur was born in India in 1992 and moved to Canada four years later. She became popular on Instagram and Tumblr through sharing her short visual poetry. As a 21-year-old university student Kaur wrote, illustrated, and self-published her first poetry collection, milk and honey (2014). Next came its artistic sibling, the sun and her flowers (2017). These collections have sold over 8 million copies and have been translated into over 42 languages. Her most recent book, home body (2020), debuted at #1 on bestsellers lists across the world. Her work touches on love, loss, trauma, healing, femininity, and migration. She lives in Brampton, Ontario.
